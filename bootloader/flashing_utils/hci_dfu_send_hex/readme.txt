'hci_dfu_send_hex.exe' is a 32-bit windows application that can perform device firmware 
upgrade over HCI-UART interface. This application accepts firmware to be upgraded in hex 
format as a command line argument along with the COM Port to be used for the transport. 



The application can take following command line arguments:

  --help, -h                       Show help message and exits.
  --file FILE, -f FILE             Filename of Hex file. This is mandatory to provide.
  --port COMPORT, -p COMPORT       COM Port to which the device is connected. This is mandatory to provide.
  --flowcontrol, -fc               Enable flow control, default: disabled.
  --baudrate BAUDRATE, -b BAUDRATE Desired baudrate 
                                   38400/96000/115200/230400/250000/460800/921600/1000000 (default: 38400). 
                                   Note: Baud rates >115200 are supported by nRF51822, 
                                         but may not be supported by all RS232 devices on windows.


If it is required to upload a firmware image 'ble_app_hrs.hex' located at C:\NewFirmware, 
and the COMPORT on which the nRF device is connected is COM7, and flow control is to be 
used for transfer run the application with command line options:
 
   hci_dfu_send_hex.exe -f  C:\NewFirmware\ble_app_hrs.hex -p COM7 -fc

Note 1: HCI features like retransmission have not been implement in this application.

The application provides comprehensive messages to provide the progress of the firmware 
upgrade or the reason for failure in case the procedure did not succeed. However, the 
application is experimental and is has only been tested on Windows 7 systems.
